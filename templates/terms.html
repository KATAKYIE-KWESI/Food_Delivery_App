  📄 JollyFoods Terms and Conditions
1. Acceptance of Terms
These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the JollyFoods mobile application and website (collectively, the "Service"), provided by [Your Company Legal Name, e.g., KatCompany] ("JollyFoods," "we," "us," or "our").

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you must not use the Service.

2. Service Description and Role of JollyFoods
JollyFoods operates as a technology platform connecting users ("Customers") with independent third-party restaurants ("Vendors") and independent third-party delivery personnel ("Delivery Partners") to facilitate the ordering, sale, and delivery of food and beverages.

Our Role:

We do not prepare the food. We are not a restaurant.

We are responsible for processing your order and facilitating its transmission to the Vendor and the Delivery Partner.

We act solely as an intermediary between you, the Vendor, and the Delivery Partner.

3. User Accounts
Eligibility: You must be at least 18 years old to create an account and place orders.

Account Information: You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process (including the email we use for welcome communication) and to keep your account password secure.

Responsibility: You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

4. Ordering and Food Preparation
Placing an Order: An order placed through the Service constitutes a binding offer by you to purchase the food from the selected Vendor.

Acceptance: The contract for the sale of food is formed only when the Vendor accepts your order. JollyFoods will notify you of the Vendor's acceptance (e.g., via app notification or email).

Food Quality: Vendors are responsible for the quality, safety, and hygiene of the food they prepare and for ensuring it complies with all relevant local laws and regulations (e.g., Ghana Food and Drugs Authority standards).

Allergens: JollyFoods is not responsible for food preparation or allergen information. It is your responsibility to contact the Vendor directly regarding specific allergen information before placing an order.

5. Pricing, Payment, and Cancellations
Pricing: Prices listed on the Service are determined by the Vendors. JollyFoods may apply service fees, delivery fees, and applicable taxes.

Payment: All payments must be made using the methods provided on the Service (e.g., mobile money, card payments). You authorize us to charge the applicable amount to your selected payment method.

Cancellations (By Customer): You may cancel an order only before the Vendor has accepted or started preparing the food. Once preparation has started, the order cannot be canceled, and no refund will be issued.

Cancellations (By Vendor/JollyFoods): The Vendor or JollyFoods may cancel an order if the product is unavailable, if the Delivery Partner is unavailable, or if there are reasonable grounds to suspect fraud. You will receive a full refund in such cases.

6. Delivery
Delivery Estimates: Any delivery time provided is an estimate only. Delivery Partners operate independently, and delays may occur due to traffic, weather, or operational issues. JollyFoods is not liable for delays.

Recipient Availability: You must ensure that a recipient is available at the specified delivery address to receive the order during the estimated delivery window.

Failed Delivery: If a delivery fails due to your fault (e.g., wrong address, non-availability after repeated attempts), the Delivery Partner may dispose of the food, and you will not be entitled to a refund.

7. Intellectual Property (IP)
Our IP: All content, logos, designs, software, and technology used on the Service, including the JollyFoods name, are the exclusive property of JollyFoods or its licensors.

License to User: We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Service for personal, non-commercial use, subject to these Terms.

8. Use Restrictions
You agree not to use the Service:

In any way that violates any local or international law or regulation.

To place fraudulent orders or make false claims.

To harass, abuse, or harm another person, including Delivery Partners or Vendor staff.

To interfere with the proper working of the Service.

9. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, JollyFoods shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:

Your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.

Any conduct or content of any third party (including Vendors and Delivery Partners).

Our total liability to you for any damages arising out of or related to these Terms shall not exceed the amount paid by you for the single order giving rise to the claim.

10. Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ghana, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Accra, Ghana, to resolve any legal matter arising from these Terms.

11. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide reasonable notice (e.g., 30 days) of any material changes before the new terms take effect. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
